# Tavern test cases for the PCS transitions API
# Author: Mitch Schooler
# Service: Power Control Service

# This test assumes that all NodeBMCs in HSM do not support "On" power
# transitions. Need to ensure this is the case when spinning up emulated
# hardware in runCT.sh. The current configuration with RIE instances only
# support "Soft-Restart" or no power transitions

# This test also assumes that all NodeEnclosures in HSM do not support any
# power transitions. Need to ensure this is the case when spinning up
# emulated hardware in runCT.sh

# HMS test metrics test cases: 2
# POST /transitions unsupported power transition NodeBMC fails
# POST /transitions unsupported power transition NodeEnclosure fails
