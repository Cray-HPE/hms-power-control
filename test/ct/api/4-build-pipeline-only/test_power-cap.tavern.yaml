# Tavern test cases for the PCS power-cap API
# Author: Mitch Schooler
# Service: Power Control Service

#TODO: this is broken since power-cap requires 'Ready' nodes which are not being set up in simulation environment

# HMS test metrics test cases: 3
# POST /power-cap/snapshot compute node
# GET /power-cap/{taskID} compute node snapshot
# GET /power-cap compute node
